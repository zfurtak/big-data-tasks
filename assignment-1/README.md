# Matrix Multiplication Performance Benchmarking 

This project focuses on comparing the performance of matrix multiplication implementations in Python, Java, and C. 🏎️

## Key Points: 🔑
- **Languages Compared:** Python, Java, and C are benchmarked for their performance in matrix multiplication, highlighting their unique strengths and trade-offs
- **Benchmarking Metrics:** The project evaluates execution times across the three languages to provide comprehensive insights
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Standard matrix multiplication algorithms are implemented in Python, Java, and C, without any optimizations
- **Matrix Sizes:** Experiments involve matrix sizes ranging from 5x5 to 200x200, enabling a thorough analysis of performance characteristics across different dimensions
- **Methodologies:** Distinct benchmarking methodologies tailored to each language are employed - Pytest for Python, JMH for Java, and manual time calculations for C
