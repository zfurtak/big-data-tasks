# Optimized Matrix Multiplication Performance Benchmarking
This project focuses on comparing the performance of matrix multiplication optimized implementations: Blocking, Column Blocking, Sparse Matrix Multiplication. 🏎️

Key Points: 🔑
Language used: Java as in the previous report obtained the best results.
Benchmarking Metrics: The project evaluates execution times across different optimizationn of multiplying matrices.
Algorithms Implementations: Blocking, Column Blocking, Multiplying Matrices represented by hash map structure.
Matrix Sizes: Experiments involve matrix sizes ranging from 10x10 to 2000x2000, and additionally Markov model of epidemic matrix with size 525,825x525,825.
Methodologies: using Java benchmarking framework: Java Microbenchmarking Harness in version 1.32 with Java 17.0.8.
Sneak peak: result are awesome and very fast ⚡️
